# RockPaperScissors

<h2><b>Objective</b></h2> - Creating a Rock Paper Scissors game was part of the Odin Project Curriculum, but it was only for the debugger console. I wanted to expand the project to have a full user interface, have the appeal of an actual game, and later I included responsive settings in CSS to make it more mobile friendly.

<h2><b>How I did it</b></h2> -  The game uses Math.floor and Math.random functions to determine the computer choice from an array. After we retrieve the player choice using event listeners, we determine the outcome of the game with if functions and logical operators. A number of counters are present as well, for calculating rounds and scores, and we feed the web page using embedded expressions, so that we can pass the player/computer choice directly to HTML through JS.

<h2><b>Greatest challenge</b></h2> - The complexity of this project required tacking issues one at a time. Something would randomly stop working, or return unexpected results. The use of the debugger was crucial to the projects success. An added challenge was getting the live version to work, as GitHub was not adding the images to the game.

<h2><b>What I learned</b></h2> - JS DOM manipulation, Math functions, working with an Array, improved my knowledge of using Firefox Debugger, and troubleshooting GitHub pages.
